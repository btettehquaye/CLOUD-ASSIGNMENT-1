## Describe at least 15 operators and what they're used for in bash script. 

In Bash scripting, operators are used to perform various operations such as arithmetic functions, string comparisons, file testing, and more  They are used to determine whether a condition is true or not, which is essential for creating conditionals and making Bash scripts dynamic.

There are 5 basic operators in bash/shell scripting:
* Arithmetic Operators
* Relational Operators
* Boolean Operators
* Bitwise Operators
* File Test Operators
  
There are several operators under each of the above stated operators

The Arithmetic Operator are operators are used to perform normal arithmetics/mathematical operations such as  such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus. Some examples of arithmetic operators include +, -, *, /, %, etc.

Relational Operators are those operators which define the relation between two operands. They give either true or false depending upon the relation.

File operators are used to test a particular property of a file, for example whether they exist, whether they have write, read, execute access etc,

Boolean are also known as logical operators. These are used to perform logical operations and are also used to combine multiple conditions in a Bash script. Some examples of boolean operators include && (AND), || (OR), and ! (NOT).
